# Healtify

Healtify is an Android application built natively, designed to assist users in monitoring their calorie intake. Alongside tracking calories, it also provides information on the amount of fat, protein, and carbohydrates consumed, as well as their recommended intake levels.

To calculate the user's calorie requirements, the app collects data such as height, weight, and activity level during the onboarding process. Subsequently, a user-friendly dashboard displays this data using visual graphs for easy comprehension.

# Installation

Clone the project from android studio after enabling VCS, and click on the run button
